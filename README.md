# Challenge 6 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard




## User Story


As a  busy student, I want to be able to search for current weather conditions 
as well as a five day forecast for a particular city, so that I can dress accordingly. 
When I refresh the page, I want to have my search history saved.
